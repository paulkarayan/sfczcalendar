# Actual info from Ellen
I'd like the main title to say: San Francisco Bay Area Cajun/Zydeco Dance Calendars.   As for the image, I'm thinking maybe alligators dancing on or in front of the Golden Gate Bridge?  I like your idea of including the Golden Gate Bridge and the accordion.  Maybe an alligator holding an accordion on or in front of the bridge with a couple of alligators dancing? 

When I tried using Hosinger, I tried two different options for the calendars.  One was the current format - basically one page and clicking on a particular month (with multiple months listed) to get to the pdf version of the calendar.   A second version I tried was to have multiple pages (one page per calendar month) with tabs at the top to get to each page.  That's more work, though, because all the tabs, etc. would need to be continually updated.  I'm fine with whatever is easier.  I'm guessing that a one page format like I have now is probably the easiest way to go.  That works for me! 

So it could be one page with the title, image, and links to each month.  Ideally, I'd like somewhere smaller at the bottom for it to say:  Maintained by Ellen Papper.  If you have any updates, corrections, etc., please email them to epapper@sbcglobal.net.  

The calendar is accessible now so you can see what it looks like.  If the control panel and file manager ever start working again, I'll copy the code (or take a picture of it), so you can see how things currently work.  

I just reread your email and I thought of one more thing. When I tried Hosinger, it had me save the files to a google drive.  That part was easy but then there were multiple steps I had to go through to get them uploaded to the webpage. It sounds like you have an automated way to do that.  That would be great.  

## Claude plan

 Phase 1 (Immediate): Static site with manual PDF links
  - Basic HTML/CSS/Tailwind site
  - Hardcoded PDF links
  - Ellen uploads to Google Drive, you update links

  Phase 2 (Later): Semi-automated
  - Google Drive PRIVATE folder
  - Simple JS to read folder contents
  - Auto-display new PDFs

  Phase 3 (Future): Fully automated
  - Google Drive API integration
  - Auto-refresh
  - Calendar preview thumbnails

  Ready to start building Phase 1? I'll create a simple, functional site that Ellen can use immediately while we plan the automation.
